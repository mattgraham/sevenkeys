All Scripture was given to mankind by God so that everyone may know Him, believe that Jesus is the Christ and respond to Him in loving faith and obedience, thus receiving eternal life (Jn. 12:48; 17:3; 20:31; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; 2 Pet. 1:19-21; 1 Jn. 2:25; 5:11, 20). This includes the book of Revelation (Rev. 1:3; 22:7).

>2 Tim. 3:16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.

>John 20:31 These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. (Jn. 17:3)

Since the majority of people throughout history have been poor and uneducated, the Bible was written in common, everyday language with them in mind. In other words, God intended and directed the Scriptures to be written in such a way that it transcends age, gender, socio-economic status, culture and generation. This way, everyone from least to greatest can understand it clearly and respond to it in genuine faith (Mk. 12:37; 2 Pet. 1:20-21).

We know that Scripture assumes its message is clear and straightforward because everyone is universally held responsible to respond to its content in faith or suffer the consequences of its rejection (Lk. 16:27-31; Jn. 3:36; 2 Thes. 1:6-10). This includes the book of Revelation (Rev. 1:3; 21:5-8, 27; 22:7, 15).

>Rev. 21:5 Then He who sat on the throne said... "Write, for these words [Revelation] are true and faithful..." 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."

A common misconception is that the book of Revelation is impossible to understand unless you're an elite scholar who has been well educated in the original languages. This is simply a deception from the evil one to keep the Church from receiving greater insight into the person of Jesus Christ (Rev. 1:1) and His end-time plan (2 Cor. 4:3; 11:3). Satan reasons that if the Church doesn't know the true Jesus of the Bible, then we can never be saved (Jn. 17:3) and mature to become like Him (2 Cor. 3:18). Likewise, if we don't know His end-time plans, we can never partner with Him to release those plans through prayer (Mt. 16:18-19), and bring the Kingdom of Heaven to earth in the restoration of all things (Mt. 6:10; Acts 3:21)!

>2 Cor. 4:3 If our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 4whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.

Therefore, we shouldn't be surprised that a great battle rages around the book of Revelation to dismiss it as invalid, confuse it with various interpretations or cause the Church to fear its contents, imagining that the events in the book happen to them instead of being released through them!

I believe that anyone can learn the main storyline of the book of Revelation in less than one hour and be able to explain it to someone else in less than one day if they want to! Of course, we will continue to gain greater insight into the book of Revelation forever, but we don't have to wait until the age-to-come to begin growing in the knowledge of God. In fact, the Lord desires this particular book to be understood so much that it is the only book in the Bible that promises a special blessing for all who read, hear and respond to it in faith.

>Rev. 1:3 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep [respond to] those things which are written in it; for the time is near. (Rev. 22:7)

  The Lord promised that in the decades leading up to His return, the saints will understand the end-time plan of God "perfectly" or in a mature way (Jer. 23:19-20; 30:24). An angel told Daniel, that although none of the wicked would understand God's plans, the wise would not only understand them and partner with the Lord to release them, but they would instruct many about this plan as well (Dan. 11:32-33; 12:10).

>Jer. 23:19 For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, and has perceived and heard His word? 20 The anger of the Lord will not turn back until He has executed and performed the thoughts of His heart [His plans]. In the latter days you will understand it perfectly [in a mature way]. (Jer 30:24)

>Dan. 11:32 the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits. 33 And those of the people who understand shall instruct many...

>Dan. 12:9 And he said, "Go your way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. 10. . . and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.

The book of Revelation is so dear to the Lord and vital to the maturity of the Church that in the final chapter, Jesus clearly warns all those who hear the book to never alter the simplicity or significance of it. If they do, He promises that God will remove His blessings from them and release His judgments upon them (Rev. 22:18-19).

>Rev. 22:18 For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 19and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

The book of Revelation was simply written to be easily understood by everyone!
