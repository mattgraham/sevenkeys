Many begin confused and end up frustrated when trying to learn the book of Revelation for themselves. Surprisingly, we were never meant to learn the Bible that way. In fact, we can actually learn nothing about God by ourselves, but all of us need the Lord's help. That's right, it takes God to know God! The Bible is explicitly clear on the point that without Him, we can do nothing (Jn. 15:5)!

>Jn. 15:5 I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.

The very fact that you desire to know more about God is certain evidence of His divine influence upon your heart. The truth is that without His inspiration, we would never desire to seek Him in the first place, since our carnal mind is literally at war with Him continually (Rom. 8:7). However, you can be certain that if God gives you the desire to seek Him, the same God will give you the power to follow through on that desire (Phil. 2:13). In His good pleasure, the Lord wants you to know Himâ€”even more than you want to know Him yourself. We aren't convincing Him to do anything; rather He is convincing us He wants to!

>Phil. 2:13 It is God who works in you both to will [inspire] and to do [empower] for His good pleasure.

For this reason, Jesus said that when He ascended back to heaven, He would send His people the Helper who would be our teacher forever. Say 'hello' to the Holy Spirit who was sent to teach us all things, remind us of everything that Jesus said, testify about Jesus (what He thinks, feels, does), guide us into all truth, tell us things to come and glorify Jesus (Jn. 14:16, 19-21, 26; 15:26; 16:12-15; 1 Cor. 2:9-12; 1 Jn. 2:20, 27).

>Jn. 14:26 But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.

>Jn. 15:26 But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me.

>Jn. 16:13 However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth...and He will tell you things to come. 14 He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.'

Immediately following Jesus' command to John, he was escorted by the Holy Spirit into heaven.

>Rev. 4:1 Behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.' 2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne.

The Spirit, like a divine "search engine,' is our escort into the deep things of God's heart. I've heard it said, "I wish I could see what the angels see.' In reality, we've been given divine eyes that see far beyond!

>1 Cor. 2:9 "eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.' 10But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God... 12Now we have received... the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.

This is great news because it means that as long as we are hungry, humble and willing to learn, the Holy Spirit will teach us everything in a way that we can easily understand. This includes the book of Revelation.

>1 Jn. 2:27 The anointing [Holy Spirit] which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but... the same anointing teaches you concerning all things...

God promised that everyone who asks receives, he who seeks finds, and to him that knocks the door would be opened (Lk. 11:9-13). Therefore, our confidence in learning the book of Revelation rests upon the Holy Spirit's abilities as a great teacher and not because we are such great learners.

>Lk. 11:9 "So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 10For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 11If a son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish?  12Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 13If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit [and His help] to those who ask Him!"

Jesus corrected the "spiritual" of His day for seeking eternal life through a purely academic study of the Word apart from cultivating a present-tense relationship with Him by "coming to Him" (Jn. 5:39-40). We do this by consistently searching the Scriptures with a teachable spirit, while asking Him questions about what He thinks, feels and does by the power of the Holy Spirit within us. As we receive greater insight into the Revelation of Jesus Christ for ourselves, we benefit from the eternal life that flows from Him as we learn!

>Jn. 5:39 You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me. But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.

Understanding our deep dependence upon the Holy Spirit to understand anything about Jesus - His person, calling, inheritance and power, Paul prayed for a spirit of revelation to be given to the saints (Eph. 1:17-19).

>Eph. 1:17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 18the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe . . .

The Holy Spirit is our Teacher in understanding the book of Revelation!
