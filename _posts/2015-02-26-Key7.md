Understanding the timing in which Jesus begins to break the seals and open the scroll, releasing the twenty-one judgment events in the book of Revelation is one interpretive key to understanding the book (Rev. 6:1).

>Rev. 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals... 5 Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals..." 7 Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.

The twenty-one judgment events in the book of Revelation are considered as the "three numbered judgment series" because they are simply three unique sets of God's judgments that are numbered sequentially in the order they unfold 1-2-3-4-5-6-7, as seen in seven seals (Rev. 6), seven trumpets (Rev. 8-9) and seven bowls of wrath (Rev. 15-16).

As the seals are broken and the scroll is unrolled, the judgments written in it are released upon the earth against the kingdom of darkness through the end-time prayer movement under Jesus' leadership (Ps. 149:6-9; 2 Chr. 20:21-22; Is. 24:14-16; 42:10-13; Acts 2:17-21; Rev. 5:8; 6:9-11; 8:3-5; 9:13; 10:6; 14:18; 16:7; 19:2; 22:17). We need not fear that they happen to us as helpless victims of Satan, but rather, are released through us as active participants under Jesus' leadership. The Church releases these in dynamic partnership with Jesus through global unified eschatological prayers of faith (Mt. 16:18-19; Lk. 18:7-8; Rev. 22:17).

>Lk. 18:7 And shall God not avenge [release justice for] His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them? 8 I tell you that He will avenge them speedily [3 1/2 years].

>Rev. 22:17 The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come!" [7th trumpet]

The praying Church that is connected to Jesus are the only ones on the earth with the "keys" of heavenly authority to contend against the kingdom of darkness, binding demonic influence and loosing the glory of God on the earth (Mt. 16:18-19).

>Mt. 16:18 I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 19 And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven [intercession], and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."

As Moses "stretched forth his rod" to release ten of the most severe plagues of God against Pharaoh in Egypt through prayer (Ex. 7-12), so also the end-time Church, as a corporate Moses will stretch forth the "rod of intercession" to release twenty-one of the most severe judgments of God in human history against the end-time Pharaoh (Antichrist), during the Great Tribulation (Rev. 6-19). The "miracles and judgments" in the book of Exodus and the "signs and wonders" in the book of Acts will be combined, multiplied and released in power on a global level by the end-time Church through prayer, as seen in Revelation (Joel 2:28-32; Acts 2:17-19; Rev. 6-19). The miracles of Egypt will reoccur in the end-times (Isa. 10:24-27; 11:11-16; Jer. 16:14-15; Mic. 7:15).

>Mic. 7:15 "As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them wonders."

>Isa. 10:24 Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: "O My people, who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian [Antichrist]. He shall strike you with a rod and lift up his staff against you, in the manner of Egypt. 25 For yet a very little while and the indignation will cease, as will My anger in their destruction." 26 And the Lord of hosts will stir up a scourge for him... as His rod was on the sea [with Moses], so will He lift it up in the manner of Egypt [against Antichrist]. 27 It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck...

Jesus has not yet opened the scroll. It wasn't opened at the time of His ascension in approximately 30 AD, but only sometime after His appearance and command to John to write the book of Revelation in approximately 90 AD (Rev. 4:1).

>Rev. 4:1 After these things [7 letters in 90 AD] I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice [Jesus], which I heard, was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this."

All 21 events of the three numbered judgment series are yet future. They haven't literally or ultimately occurred in history, although many historic events contain similar elements that foreshadow these ultimate future occurrences in part, giving us some insight into how they may unfold in the end-times.

The following interpretive views are correct in part, however the greatest application and ultimate fulfillment of these twenty-one judgment events are yet future.

1. The Preterist view sees much of Revelation as having been fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem and fall of Rome in 70 AD. The problem with this view is that Jesus had not yet revealed these to John in 70 AD, but approximately 20 years later in 90 AD after the destruction of Jerusalem (Mt. 24:1-2), clearly describing these events as future (Rev. 4:1).
2. The Historicist view interprets much of Revelation as already being fulfilled in a progressive unfolding throughout Church history.
3. The Idealist view does not see a unique end-time application of Revelation, but interprets it as a symbolic picture of the spiritual conflict of "good vs. evil" that has occurred throughout all history.

Like Moses, how can we release them except we understand them? Therefore a key to understanding the timing of releasing these twenty-one judgment events is the maturity of the Church. The Lord promised mature understanding of this plan in the latter days for all who desire it and search it out (Jer. 23:20; 30:24).

>Jer. 23:20 The anger of the Lord will not turn back Until He has executed and performed the thoughts of His heart. In the latter days you will understand it perfectly.

Jesus takes the scroll and begins to break the seals, releasing judgment only after the bowls of prayer are completely full (Rev. 5:8). In other words, the seals aren't broken until the prayer movement has matured enough to release the judgments and rule the earth with Jesus during the Millennium with the right spirit and for the right reasons – that humility and love would cover the earth as God is obeyed and adored in every nation.

>Rev. 5:8 Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 9 And they sang a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 10 and have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth."

The key judgment events in the book of Revelation are yet future!
