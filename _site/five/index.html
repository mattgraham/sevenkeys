<p>Revelation is a book that contains multiple symbols. Surprising to most is the fact that there are only a few main symbols in Revelation that are sufficient to understand the main storyline of the book. The Lord has made it so simple that not only are these symbols indicated within the book, but they are interpreted within the book as well (Rev. 1:20; 5:6; 11:8; 12:1, 3, 9; 17:7, 9, 12, 15-18)!</p>

<p>In Revelation 1, Jesus tells us plainly that the mystery John saw of the &quot;seven lampstands&quot; (Rev. 1:12-13) is symbolic of the &quot;seven churches&quot; and that the &quot;seven stars&quot; in His right hand (Rev. 1:16) are symbolic of the &quot;seven angels&quot; of the seven churches (Rev. 1:20).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 1:20 The mystery of the seven stars ...and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Revelation 12, the sign of the &quot;dragon&quot; (Rev. 12:3) is interpreted a few verses later as the &quot;Devil and Satan&quot; (Rev. 12:9) and again in chapter 20 using the same language (Rev. 20:2). It also clarifies that he is the &quot;serpent of old&quot; that was found in the Garden, tempting Adam and Eve (Gen. 3).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Revelation 17, which is one of the most symbolic passages in all of Scripture, the mystery of the &quot;woman&quot; (Rev. 17:1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), the &quot;beast&quot; (Rev. 17:3, 7), the &quot;seven heads&quot; (Rev. 17:3, 7), the &quot;ten horns&quot; (Rev. 17:3, 7) and the &quot;waters&quot; where the woman sits (Rev. 17:1, 7) are all interpreted within the very same chapter (Rev. 17:8-18)!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 17:7 But the angel said to me, &quot;Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery [symbols] of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. 9The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. 10There are also seven kings. 11The beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth [king], and is of the seven, and is going to perdition. 12The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast. 15...the waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues. 18And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To arbitrarily or haphazardly call something symbolic when God didn&#39;t intend it to be symbolic is not only biblically reckless, but deceptive and brings unnecessary confusion to many sincere believers.</p>

<p>Another principle related to symbols is that the Bible interprets the Bible. This means that if the book of Revelation indicates that something is symbolic and it doesn&#39;t interpret that symbol in the immediate text of the book itself, you can be sure that you will find its interpretation somewhere else in the Bible. For example, the &quot;sword&quot; proceeding from Jesus&#39; mouth (Rev. 1:16; 2:12, 16; 19:15, 21) is symbolic of the &quot;Word of God,&quot; which is interpreted in the books of Ephesians and Hebrews (Eph. 6:17; Heb. 4:12).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eph. 6:13 Take up the whole armor of God 17 ...and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God...</p>

<p>Heb. 4:12 The word of God is living and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the few main symbols found within the book of Revelation, there are multiple secondary symbols as well. However, by simply identifying the few primary symbols, you can clearly understand the main storyline of the book of Revelation. The 7 main symbols are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dragon: is always symbolic of &quot;Satan&quot; (Rev. 12:3, 4, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17; 13:2, 4; 16:13; 20:2).</li>
<li>Beast: is symbolic of the &quot;Antichrist,&quot; who is called the &quot;Beast&quot; 36 times in the book of Revelation (Rev. 13; 14:9-11; 17:3-17; 19:19-21; 20:4, 10) and 4 times in Daniel (Dan. 7:7, 11, 19, 23).</li>
<li>Another Beast: is symbolic of the &quot;False Prophet,&quot; who is called &quot;another Beast&quot; just once (Rev. 13:11). Every other time he is identified as the False Prophet (Rev. 13:11-17; 16:13; 19:20; 20:10).</li>
<li>Seven Heads: are symbolic of the &quot;7 historical Gentile world empires&quot; that persecute Israel: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome and the future Antichrist empire (Dan. 2:41-42; 7:7; Rev. 12:3; 13:1; 17:3-16). The majority of commentators agree with this interpretation, as confirmed by history and biblical text. The combined strengths of their wickedness will increase and emerge again under the Antichrist&#39;s rule in the end-times (Rev. 13:1-2).</li>
<li>Ten Horns: are symbolic of a future &quot;confederation&quot; that receives governmental authority to rule with the Antichrist (Dan. 2:41-42; 7:7, 20, 24; 11:36-45; Rev. 12:3; 13:1; 17:3, 7, 12, 16).</li>
<li>Harlot Babylon: is symbolic of a &quot;global religious and economic system&quot; that is demonically-inspired and empowered from the center of the rebuilt city of Babylon on the Euphrates River, 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq. This ancient city will be restored and used as a command post for the Antichrist to seduce many to sin, while persecuting Israel and the saints (Isa. 13-14; Jer. 50-51; Rev. 17-18).</li>
<li>Woman with Male-Child: is symbolic of the &quot;faithful remnant of ethnic Israel&quot; throughout history that &quot;gave birth&quot; to &quot;Jesus, the Male-Child&quot; who will &quot;rule all nations with a rod of iron&quot; (Mt. 1:1-17; Rev. 12:1-5). Satan wars with the &quot;rest of her offspring&quot; who are Gentile believers (Rev. 12:17).</li>
</ol>

<p>Some might ask, &quot;If Jesus meant Revelation to be simple, then why did he make things symbolic?&quot; First, simple is not the opposite of symbolic. Symbols can be simple. A symbol that represents an object can say much more with less language than a detailed verbal or written description of it. For example, Jesus holding the &quot;7 stars&quot; in His right hand says much more in a symbolic way than listing each individual truth about His tenderly upholding, directing and protecting His apostolic messengers of the seven churches.</p>

<p>Jesus used symbols like parables, to hide divine truth from the proud and unbelieving, while giving deep insight to the humble and hungry. He understood that those who are sincerely seeking would always search out the truth for themselves, regardless of the personal cost, resistance or embarrassment (Mt. 13:10-13; Lk. 1:52-53; Jn. 6:68-69). Knowing this, He would often offend the mind for the purpose of revealing the heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mt. 13:34 Jesus spoke... in parables; and without a parable He did not speak. 35&quot;...I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.&quot; (Mt. 13:10-17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understand that God didn&#39;t hide the meaning of the symbols from us, but for us to find (Pr. 25:2)! Searching out the interpretation of the symbols found in the book of Revelation is exhilarating - and our kingly glory!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prov. 25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.</p>
