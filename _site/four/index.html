<h1 id="fittext_2">Key 4: The book of Revelation is meant to be understood literally!</h1>

<p>Since the book of Revelation was written for the majority of those on earth to understand and not just a few scholars, it is meant to be understood using an everyday, common sense approach. We call this the &quot;literal&quot; method of scriptural interpretation (also the historical-grammatical method), wherein we seek to understand the plain meaning of the text that the author originally intended for his readers to have (Rev. 1:11, 19; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 14:13; 19:9; 21:5). The book of Revelation says what it means and means what it says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 1:19 Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after this.</p>

<p>Rev. 21:5 And He said to me, &quot;Write, for these words are true and faithful.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In using the literal method of interpretation we do not deny other literary aspects, genre or figures of speech, such as parable, allegory, simile or metaphor. We acknowledge the use of symbols throughout the book; yet we understand that nothing in the book is meant to be taken symbolically unless the text specifically indicates it as such. An example of this would be the &quot;mystery&quot; of the seven stars (Rev. 1:20), the &quot;mystery&quot; of the seven lampstands (Rev. 1:20), the &quot;sign&quot; of the woman clothed with the sun (Rev. 12:1), the &quot;sign&quot; of the great fiery red dragon (Rev. 12:3) or the &quot;mystery&quot; of the woman and of the beast that carries her (Rev. 17:5, 7).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 12:1 Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars... 3And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understanding that everything in the book of Revelation is to be understood literally, unless the text specifically indicates it as symbolic, makes learning the main storyline of the book so much easier. We can now simply interpret all personalities, numbers and events in their plain, common sense meaning, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li>The millennial reign of Christ, which is literally one thousand years long (Rev. 20:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)</li>
<li>The testing of the church in Smyrna for literally ten days (Rev. 2:10)</li>
<li>The sealing of one hundred and forty-four thousand Israelites, literally comprised of twelve thousand from each tribe (Rev. 7:1-8)</li>
<li>The fifth trumpet in which unbelievers are literally tormented for five months (Rev. 9:5, 10)</li>
<li>The sixth trumpet in which four literal angels are released to literally kill one-third of the human race through a literal army of two hundred million (Rev. 9:15-16, 18)</li>
<li>The final judgment when those in rebellion against God are literally cast into the Lake of Fire</li>
<li>The Lake of Fire where they will be literally tormented forever (Rev. 14:9-11; 20:7-15)</li>
</ol>

<p>Understanding the literalness of this book can &quot;literally&quot; remove much of the pointless debating and endless confusion that comes from using other broad-stroke, symbolic interpretations in which even the best and brightest scholars are in hopeless disagreement.</p>

<p>The book of Revelation is simply meant to be understood literally!
