<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God [Father] gave Him [Jesus] to show His servants...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word &quot;revelation&quot; literally means &quot;to unveil,&quot; and occurs when the Holy Spirit takes the unsearchable things of God-previously hidden from man&#39;s understanding-and reveals them to us by His grace (Jn. 14-16; 1 Cor. 2:9-11). Therefore, the book of Revelation could literally be called &quot;The unveiling of the beauty and glory of Jesus Christ,&quot; because it gives us unprecedented insight into the perfection of His heart (how He feels), His mind (how He thinks) and His leadership (how He acts) in preparing the nations for the glory of God (Hab. 2:14; Num. 14:21; Ps. 72:19; Isa. 11:9).</p>

<p>The Father desires to transform the Church into a mature Bride that is ready for His Son (Rev. 19:7; 22:17). Prior to Jesus&#39; return the Church will be fully mature in divine insight (wisdom Dan. 11:32-33; 12:10; Jer. 23:20; 30:24), godly character (fruit Eph. 4:13; 5:27) and supernatural power (gifts Mt. 16:18-19; Jn. 14:12).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 19:7 Rejoice... for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we &quot;become what we behold&quot; (2 Cor. 3:18), greater maturity of the Bride into the image of God is dependent upon a greater revelation of God. Therefore, the Holy Spirit has reserved the greatest revelation of Jesus for the end-time Church! As we behold the glory of Jesus, found throughout the book of Revelation, we are progressively transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, taking on the same qualities in our lives and ministries, both now and in the age-to-come.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 Cor. 3:18 But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Revelation also gives more insight and specific information on the end-times, including the brilliance of God&#39;s unfolding battle-plan to prepare the Church to transition the earth in mature partnership with her Bridegroom. As we grow in the knowledge of the Person of God and His plans, we are strengthened, encouraged and prepared to not only endure, but to prevail through the unique dynamics and unprecedented events of the end-times in great victory (Rev. 7:9-10; 15:2-3)!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 7:9 Behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands, 10 and crying out with a loud voice, saying, &quot;Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!&quot;</p>

<p>Rev. 15:2 And I saw... those who have the victory over the beast, over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God. 3They sing... &quot;Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Rev. 1, Jesus highlights 52 distinct aspects of His eternal majesty, strategically given in 14 titles, 10 attributes (inherent qualities) and 28 descriptions that were meant to transform John (2 Cor. 3:18), giving him perspective to interpret, pray and prophesy the following events (Rev. 10:10-11). These words are not random truths, but very strategically reveal the glory of who Jesus is, equipping our hearts to respond to Him in very specific ways. If we respond correctly to Jesus according to the truths given throughout the book of Revelation, we can be confident that we are prepared for what lies just ahead of us in the end-times!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 1:10 I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet, 11 saying, &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last...&quot; 12 And having turned I saw... 13One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band. 14His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire; 15His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters; 16He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength. 17And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, &quot;Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. 18 I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like walking out of a dark room into the blazing light of the sun, be patient as your eyes slowly adjust to the revelation light of the Son of Man in the book of Revelation. We will slowly begin to see more details over time as we consistently behold these truths with a teachable spirit and talk to Him about them (Jn. 5:39-40).</p>

<p>The Church will partner with Jesus, having a vibrant spirit (Dan. 11:32; Jn. 7:38; Eph. 3:16-19), being victorious over darkness and having authority in intercession only to the degree that we understand the revelation of Jesus Christ, who is fully God and fully Man (Dan. 7:13-14; Mt. 16:13-19; Rev. 1:13; 14:14).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mt. 16:13 &quot;Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?&quot; 14So they said, &quot;Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&quot; 15He said to them, &quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot; 16Simon Peter answered and said, &quot;You are the Christ [humanity], the Son of the living God [divinity].&quot; 18And... on this rock [of truth] I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 19And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>Jn. 7:38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone might say, &quot;I&#39;m not really into the book of Revelation or the end-times scriptures.&quot; If understood correctly, the end-times are really all about Jesus! Just as the four gospel accounts (totaling 89 chapters) give us a record of Jesus&#39; beauty, power and leadership at His first coming, so the end-time scriptures (over 150 chapters) describe Jesus&#39; beauty, power and leadership at His second coming to fulfill what He began over 2000 years ago. The book of Revelation describes the final, unfolding gospel storyline in which the Kingdom of God collides with the kingdom of darkness, and God delivers His people, along with the planet from the power of Satan-forever! The four gospels AND the end-time scriptures both reveal the same Jesus, operating in the same power of the same Holy Spirit, using the same wisdom, under the same authority of the same Father, recorded in the same Bible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heb. 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. (Ps. 102:27; Mal. 3:6; Heb. 1:12)!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book of Revelation reveals the glory of a Man, the wisdom of His plan and the power of His hand!
