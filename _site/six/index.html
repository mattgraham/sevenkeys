<p>Contrary to popular belief, the main theme of Revelation isn&#39;t Satan&#39;s persecution of the saints. Rather, it is Jesus&#39; victory over the enemies of God when He returns on the Day of the Lord to establish His Father&#39;s Kingdom over the nations of the earth forever (Dan. 7:13-14, 18, 22, 27; Jude 14-15; Rev. 1:7; 11:15-19)!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 11:15 The 7th angel sounded: And there were loud voices in heaven saying, &quot;The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!&quot;</p>

<p>Ps. 72:8 He shall have dominion from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth... 11 Yes, all kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The emphasis on the Day of the Lord throughout Revelation (Rev. 6:17) refers to the unique dynamics and unusual events, both great and terrible, surrounding Jesus&#39; victorious return (Joel 2:11, 31; Mal. 4:5).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Joel 2:11 For the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; who can endure it? (Joel 2:31; Mal. 4:5)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Day of the Lord is &quot;His Day&quot; or the &quot;Day that the Lord has made&quot; (Ps. 118). It will be a great day for the responsive who will experience the greatest revival in human history (Acts 2:17-19; Rev. 12:10). At the same time, it will be a very terrible day for the rebellious who experience twenty-one of God&#39;s most severe judgments in world history, during the 3 1/2 years of the Great Tribulation (Mt. 24:21; Rev. 7:14).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, &quot;Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. 11 And they [saints] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death. 12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time [3 1/2 years].&quot;</p>

<p>Mt. 24:21 Then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world... nor ever shall be. 22And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved... (Dan. 12:1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need not fear God&#39;s judgments happen to us as helpless victims of Satan, but rather, are released through us as active participants under Jesus&#39; leadership (Joel 2:28-32; Acts 2:17-19). As Jesus opens the scroll, the judgments contained within it are released on earth against the kingdom of darkness through the global unified prayers of the end-time Church (Ps. 149:6-9; 2 Chr. 20:21-22; Is. 24:14-16; 42:10-13; Jl. 2:28-32; Mt. 16:18-19; Acts 2:17-21; Rev. 5:8; 6:9-11; 8:3-5; 9:13; 10:6; 14:18; 16:7; 19:2; 22:17).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ps. 149:6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth... 7 To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples... 9 To execute on them the written judgment- this honor have all His saints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Day of the Lord has both a narrow and broad application. The &quot;narrow day&quot; is a literal 24 hr. day in which Jesus returns to Jerusalem in great victory (Zech. 14:1-9; Mt. 23:39). The &quot;broad day&quot; refers to the time when Jesus begins to manifest His power openly, culminating at the end of the Millennium when He delivers the Kingdom to God the Father with a fully restored earth (Ps. 90:4; 1 Cor. 15:24-28; 2 Pet. 3:8).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 Cor. 15:24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power... 28 Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On His Day, Jesus will take legal dominion of the earth (Gen. 1:26-28) in partnership with the saints. His kingdom is comprehensive, everlasting and incorruptible (Dan. 7:13-14, 18, 22, 27; Rev. 11:15-19).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dan. 7:13 Behold, One like the Son of Man, coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him. 14Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom the one which shall not be destroyed. (Rev. 1:7)  </p>

<p>Zech. 14:5 The LORD will come, and all the saints... 7 It shall be one day which is known to the LORD - neither day nor night... 9 And the LORD shall be King over all the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus will literally &quot;make war&quot; in order to establish everlasting peace. The conflict that began in ages past during Satan&#39;s rebellion will physically manifest on the earth between two literal armies: the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness (Rev. 17:14; 19:11, 14-15, 19-21). Jesus will violently confront and destroy everything that stands in opposition to His Kingdom, His will and His ways (Ps. 2:1-12; Rev. 19:11-21).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 19:11 Behold, a white horse. He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. 12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns... 13He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood... 14And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. 15Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron... 16And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. 19And I saw the beast [Antichrist], the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army. 20Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet... These two were cast alive into the lake of fire... 21And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The secondary theme of the book of Revelation is the persecution of the Jewish people and the saints by the Antichrist and his empire. However, we must keep this in clear perspective. Out of a total of 404 verses in the book of Revelation, only 12 of those verses (less than 3%) speak directly about persecution (Rev. 6:9-11; 11:7; 12:17; 13:7, 15; 16:6; 17:6; 18:24; 19:2; 20:4). The other 392 verses in the book of Revelation (over 97%) describe Jesus&#39; and our victory over Satan and the kingdom of darkness (Rev. 1-3; 4:9-11; 5:8-10; 7:1-17; 9:4; 11:3-6; 12:6, 10-11; 13-14, 14:1-5, 14-16; 15:2-4; 19:1-8; 20-21).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rev. 15:2 And I saw... those who have the victory over the beast, over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God. 3They sing . . . &quot;Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main theme of the book of Revelation is Jesus&#39; victory over the enemies of God when He returns on the Day of the Lord to establish His Father&#39;s Kingdom over the nations of the earth forever (Dan. 7:13-14, 18, 22, 27; Jude 14-15; Rev. 1:7; 11:15-19)! The great news is that we share in this victory with Him as the saints inherit the kingdom forever (Dan. 7:13-14, 18, 22, 27)!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dan. 7:18 But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever!
